# Average

A simple C++ console application that:

- Asks the user how many numbers they want to input
- Takes that many numbers as input
- Calculates and prints the **total sum**
- Calculates and prints the **average**
- Calculates and prints the **last deviation** from the average

---

## 🛠️ Build and Run

### Compile

```bash
g++ main.cpp -o average
```

### Run

```bash
./average
```

> Note: The program uses `system("clear");` which works on Linux/macOS. On Windows, replace it with `system("cls");` if needed.

## Note

The "last deviation" is the difference between the last entered number and the average. If you're looking to calculate standard deviation or full deviation list, let me know!
